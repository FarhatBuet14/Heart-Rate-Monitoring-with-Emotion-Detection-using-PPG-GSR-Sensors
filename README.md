# Heart-Rate-Monitoring-with-Emotion-Detection-using-PPG-GSR-Sensors
It's a wireless device to monitor the heart beat and emotion simultaneously. It takes PPG signal from PPG sensor and estimate the heart beat. It also takes GSR signal through GSR sensor at the same time and detect the emotion change. Through this wireless device we can also detect the heart beat dependency on emotion change.
